# TeamInfo-Generator

# Description 
A CLI Application that dynamically creates a webpage with my engineering team's basic information

# Installation
Clone repository from GitHub 

# Testing
Run npm run test on your Integrated Terminal

# Usage 
Run npm install followed by node app.js and answer the questions. The final html page is generated at output/team.html (Note: create an output folder before you run the node app.js command)

# License
None

# Code
I have created an Employee base class and sub classes for Engineer, Manager and Intern. 
In the app.js file using Inquirer, I have initialised question arrays for each sub class. When the node app.js command is run, the user is prompted for the manager info and the user decides how many engineers and interns are a part of the team. Once the user inputs the entire team's info, the team info is pushed into teamArray which is then passed as a parameter for the render function(starter code from htmlrenderer.js file). the HTML code generated by the render function is then written to a team.html file using fs.write
